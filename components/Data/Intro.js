        I'm a full stack developer (React.js & Node.js) with a focus on creating
        (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences that are
        fast, accessible, visually appealing, and responsive. Even though I have
        been creating web applications for over 7 years, I still love it as if
        it was something new.
